# Advent Of Code 2020

This year I decided to brush up my Python skills.

The project uses poetry as a package manager.

## Usage
### Install venv and dependencies
`poetry install`

### Run the daily challenges
`poetry run day<number> ./data/day<number>/input.txt`

### Run the tests
`poetry run pytest`
